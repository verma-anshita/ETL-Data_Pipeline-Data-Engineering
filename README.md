# IMDb_Rating_Project - Data Engineering (ETL pipelines)

# Introduction
A Data Engineering project where we created data pipelins to answer business questions. Generated business reports i.e. Dashboards on Tableau and Power BI to analyse data on the basis of business requirements. Integrated many tables consisting of millions of records and engineered them to perform data analysis.

# Objective
 * To build data pipelines.
 * Undestand Data Architecture and Data Modeling.
 * Understand importance of Business Intelligence and Business Analytics.
 * Develop data pipelines and perform data cleaning and pre-processing to provide useful data for business reporting and data analysis.

# Implementation
We have created data pipelines using Talend tool- have created talend jobs- and have integrated data sets from various resources stored in different fromats - CSV, Excel, Online Databases- and performed ETL (Extracted, Loaded and Transformed) datasets and migrated them to MS SQL Server and stored into staging database and then into BI database to finally perform Data Visualizations using Tableau and Power BI.

# Requirements and Tools

* You will need to have following tools installed to view project work:
    * Talend for data pipelines/ jobs
    * Power BI for visualizations 
    * Tableau for Visualizations

# Instructions to view Talend Jobs
* Download Talend tool.
* Download the IMDB folder files from repository.
* Open Talend and Import this folder into talend, select all jobs and finish.

# Outcomes
 * Generated data pipelines.
 * Answered business requirement questions.

# Additional Info
 * Have uploaded report file containing snapshots of ETL pipelines/Talend jobs created in the project.
